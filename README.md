# Real-estate-agency-management.
An application that allows customer and real estate management within a newly established real estate agency. For every home you know the name of the client who rents it, the usable area and the discount (0-10%). The apartments are known for the floor, and the houses are known how many square meters have the yard, how many floors the house has and which is the useful floor area on each floor. Obviously, the rent calculation is different. If the apartment is considered to be just the formula given by the rental price per square meter * the usable area, taking care to apply a discount where appropriate, to the house, add, regardless of the discount, the price per square meter of the yard * its surface.
